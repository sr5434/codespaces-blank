# Random Daily Haiku Newsletter
Note: This used to be a live app, but I was banned by SendGrid for no reason. I decided to shut it down to save costs. Below is a description of the app while it was live. In order to reproduce this app, one must configure these resources themselves.
The webapp can add an email to Firestore or remove it. It is made with Tailwind and NextJS(and is hosted on Google Cloud Run). The email job pulls all user email addresses and uses SendGrid to send the day's haiku. It is in Google Cloud Run Jobs and is triggered by Google Cloud Scheduler.
